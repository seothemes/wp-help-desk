Documentation and knowledge base WordPress plugin.

## Description

WP Help Desk allows you to create a user-friendly support system with features including a powerful knowledge base, support ticketing and more.

This plugin creates a new Custom Post Type called Articles which can be grouped by Topic. To display a list of all articles grouped by topic, use the built in Topics widget or use the following shortcode:

`[list-docs]`

To display a knowledgebase search form, use the built in widget or the following shortcode:

`[search-docs]`

Articles automatically generate a table of contents based on subheadings in the article.

This plugin is designed to work seamlessly with the Markdown Editor plugin.
